# IELTS Vocabulary Resource for Band 9

## Introduction

This comprehensive resource is designed for Bangladeshi students aiming for a band 9 in IELTS vocabulary sections (Reading, Listening, Speaking, Writing). It focuses on academic and formal language. The vocabulary list is compiled from reliable IELTS sources and prioritized by frequency (high: commonly used in everyday academic contexts; medium: frequently in IELTS tasks; low: advanced/rare for band 8-9). Words are organized by topic areas. The total is approximately 1000 words.

For each word:
- **English word (headword)**
- **Part of speech**
- **Clear English definition (concise)**
- **Bangla translation (natural, common Bengali)**
- **One or two example sentences (IELTS-style, formal)**
- **Short usage note or collocations**
- **Band level**: Essential for band 7–9 (advanced) or sufficient for band 6–7 (basic).

At the end of each topic, grouped mini-quizzes (10–20 items) with answers and explanations.

## Practical Study Tips

- **Active Recall**: Test yourself by recalling definitions, Bangla meanings, and examples without looking. This strengthens memory better than passive reading.
- **Mnemonics**: Create memory aids, e.g., for "abundant" (প্রচুর), think "a bun dance" – a dance with plenty of buns symbolizing plenty.
- **Flashcard Templates**: Use apps like Anki. Front: Word + POS. Back: Definition, Bangla, 1-2 examples, usage/collocation, band level.
- **How to Use in Speaking and Writing Tasks**: In Speaking Part 2, use advanced words like "accelerate" in describing a process (e.g., "Technology can accelerate economic growth"). In Writing Task 2, incorporate collocations like "pose a threat" in opinion essays (e.g., "Climate change poses a threat to biodiversity"). Practice paraphrasing with synonyms.
- **Typical IELTS Exam Examples**: Environment words appear in Reading passages on climate change; technology in Listening lectures on innovation; health in Writing Task 1 graphs on obesity trends.

## Spaced-Repetition Study Schedule (12 Weeks)

Use flashcards with daily/weekly reviews. Divide words into high (weeks 1-4), medium (weeks 5-8), low (weeks 9-12). Total: ~83 words/week.

- **Weeks 1-4 (High Frequency)**: Daily: Learn 20 new words (10 min), review all (active recall, 15 min). Weekly: Quiz on topic group, rewrite examples. Space reviews: Day 1 (learn), Day 2 (review), Day 4, Day 7.
- **Weeks 5-8 (Medium Frequency)**: Daily: 15 new words, review previous highs. Weekly: Speaking practice using 10 words in monologues. Space: Day 1, Day 3, Day 6, end of week.
- **Weeks 9-12 (Low Frequency)**: Daily: 10 new advanced words, integrate in Writing essays. Weekly: Full topic quiz, mock IELTS task. Space: Day 1, Day 4, Day 8, bi-weekly.
- **Overall**: Track progress in a journal. Review all words every 2 weeks. Adjust based on quizzes (revisit weak areas).
